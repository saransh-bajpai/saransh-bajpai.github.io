Hi, my name is Saransh Bajpai. I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Cogoport, Mumbai. Inhere, I write code on Ruby on Rails to either scale backend systems or productize business requirements alongside leading a team of half a dozen developers.

I am passionate about the startup ecosystem in India primarily in the health and education domain. When I am off tab from the office, I spend time decoding how the online-startup ecosystem is evolving, reading about first-time founders and their journey to success, and ideating on the next big timeless product to be built.

I would like to believe my hobbies are swimming, reading non-fiction, and traveling, in all of which I indulge infrequently.

Feel free to connect with me on any platform!
